## Description
Provide a detailed explanation of the project, its purpose, and features.
Understanding Key API and Software           Concepts
         API: An API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. An API acts as a waiter between the customer and the kitchen chef when ordering.

SDK: It stands for Software Development Kit and in the context of AI it refers to a collection of tools, libraries, and resources that developers use to build, integrate, and deploy AI-based applications. The AI SDK provides everything needed to work with AI models, algorithms, and platforms, enabling developers to easily create AI-powered solutions without building everything from scratch.
        
Web APIs: A Web API is a set of rules and protocols that allows software applications to communicate with each other over the internet. It provides a standardized way for developers to interact with a web service, application, or platform by sending and receiving data.

   Library APIs: These refer to programmatic interfaces provided by software libraries, which allow developers to use predefined functions, classes, and tools for a specific purpose. Library APIs are typically used within an application and are part of a software package; on the other hand, web APIs operate over the Internet.

 Prompting and Completion: Prompting and Completion are terms commonly used in the context of generative artificial intelligence (AI).
                 Prompting: Providing an input or query to an AI or language model to get the desired response or answer. In generative AI, such as Chat GPT, Gemini, or other AI models, a prompt is essential to guide an AI model in getting relevant outputs.
                  Completion: In AI, the response or output generated by AI models based on a given prompt is called completion.
